Audiogram

The Audiogram Screen is a feature that represents a person's hearing ability by plotting a graph at different frequencies, decibel levels. It is simple line graph.

Functionality:

Graph of Frequencies and Decibels:

The Audiogram Screen displays a graph where the x-axis represents different sound frequencies, and the y-axis represents the corresponding decibel levels.
Each point on the graph shows the quietest sound a person can hear at each of these frequencies. The lower the point, the better the person's hearing at that frequency.
Data Source:

The graph is based on the results from a hearing test the user has performed. During the test, the app collects data at different frequencies. This data is then used to plot the points on the graph.

User Insight:
By looking at the Audiogram, users can  understand their hearing ability. For example, if the points on the graph are high on the y-axis, it indicates that the person needs louder sound to hear at those frequencies, which suggest some hearing loss.

Tracking Changes Over Time:
Users can use the Audiogram Screen to check their hearing health at different time interval, wheter there are improvement or not. 

Informed Decisions:
With this information, users can make informed decisions about their hearing care. If the Audiogram shows significant hearing loss at certain frequencies, it might prompt the user to seek further testing or hearing aids.
